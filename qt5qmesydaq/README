QMesyDAQ application is based in part on the work of the Qwt project (http://qwt.sf.net).

The system specific configuration should be done in a file named:

qmesydaqconfig_`hostname -s`.pri

You can create this file via:

# touch qmesydaqconfig_`hostname -s`.pri

Then you may edit this file and fill the following entries

If you don't want to have a remote interface let the following entry
empty like

INTERFACE	=

allowed values ar TACO, CARESS, or TCP
INTERFACE	= TACO 

if you have a 64 bit machine add the following line
CONFIG		+= bit64

if you have the Qwt library build from sources set the value to the 
installation path
QWT_ROOT 	= /usr/local/qwt5

where are the header files of the Qwt library
QWTINCLUDE	= $${QWT_ROOT}/include

where are the library files of the Qwt library
QWTLIBS		= $${QWT_ROOT}/lib

what is the name of the Qwt library
QWTLIB		= qwt-qt4


Build a distribution

QMAKEFEATURES=`pwd`  qmake -recursive
make edist

If a remote interface is selected and it is TACO the following TACO packages
must be installed:

taco
taco-common
taco-common-io
taco-common-detector

These packages are available at:

ftp://ftp.frm2.tum.de/pub/software/taco/src/
