O  Forward streaming of the incoming data packages
  The incoming data should be streamed via an UDP port additionally and optional

1  File header in measurement file header
  The list mode files should contain an extended header (in INI format)
  see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file
  Problem: Playback of such files requires a parsing of the header

2  Conversion from channel/tube numbers to physical units
  The channel/tube numbers should be converted to physical units via configureable
  formulas

3  Display of counters (monitors, ...) besides the desired set values (for better comparison)
  The current values of different counters should be display close to the preselection
  values for better comparison.

4  Add information about position and intensity when cursor is moving over the plot
  If the cursor is moving over the plot area the position values and and intensity should
  be displayed

  Done: for spectrum like plots 2012/06/25
        open for 2D plots, due to no idea to get the intensity data

5  Additional plots 
  - Count rate plots (detector, monitor, external signals, ...) over time
    (as history)
    display over full time or fixed time window (sliding curves)
    (Q: time between recording values)
  - along tube/channel (or row/column) of 2D picture
  - 'sum spectra' over the whole tube/channel (or row/column)

6  Selecting coloring scheme in 2D plot
  The colors to display the intensity should be selected by user. The color tables could be
  configured via files. The default is the current scheme.

7  Scaling in 1D plots
  The scaling of the 1D plots should be scaled automatically by default. Optionally the user
  may set the limits manually.
  For the 'diffractogram over tube' display an additional line with the max. value should be
  added and this max value should defineable by user.

8  Disk space display
  The free disk space on the data partition (for storing the listmode file data) should be
  displayed in user front end.

  Done: JK 2012/06/25

9  Automatic list mode file naming
  In the remote operation mode the list mode file name should be controlled by the control
  software and the user should not be able to change the filename.

10 Display some additional extrema from spectra and histograms
  - in 1D spectra 
    - maximum/minimum channel 
    - counts in a ROI
  - in 2D histogram
    - maximum/minimum channel and tube
    - counts in a ROI

  Done: counts in ROI, JK 2012/06/25

11 Calibration and re-binning
  Done: re-binning, JK 2012/08/23

12 MDLL integration
  Done: JK,GM 2012/08/23

13 TOF mode
  - Chopper signal comes from external source and all events coming are considered as event
    in a time slice independing from the location on detector ==> time spectrum

Refused:

- Splitting of the list mode data files
  (File size on current OS should be large enough to store data
   of one measurement)

- Clearing data during the data acquisition 
  (May be a source of errors in real measurements, if no list mode
   data written) 
  For adjustments (of beam stop) it can be simulated by start/stop/clear
